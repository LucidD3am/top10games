    <h2>History of Super Mario Bros.</h2>
    <p>
        Super Mario Bros. is a 1985 platform game developed and published by Nintendo 
        for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The successor to the 1983 arcade 
        game Mario Bros. and the first game in the Super Mario series, it was first 
        released in 1985 for the Famicom in Japan. Following a limited US release for 
        the NES, it was ported to international arcades for the Nintendo Vs. System in 
        early 1986. The NES version received a wide release in North America that year 
        and in PAL regions in 1987.

        uper Mario Bros. was immensely successful, both commercially and critically. It helped popularize the side-scrolling platform game genre, and served as a killer app for the NES. Upon release in Japan, 1.2 million copies were 
        sold during its September 1985 release month. Within four months, about 3 million copies were sold in Japan, grossing more than Â¥12.2 billion, equivalent to $72 million at the time 
        (which is inflation-adjusted to $196 million in 2022). The success of Super Mario Bros. helped increase Famicom sales to 6.2 million units by January 1986. By 1987, 5 million copies of the game had been sold for the Famicom. 
        Outside of Japan, many were introduced to the game through the arcade version, which became the bestselling Nintendo Vs. System release with 20,000 arcade units sold within a few months in early 1986. In the United States, 
        more than 1 million copies of the NES version were sold in 1986, more than 4 million by 1988, 9.1 million by mid-1989, more than 18.7 million by early 1990, nearly 19 million by April 1990, and more than 20 million by 1991. 
        More than 40 million copies of the original NES version had been sold worldwide by 1994, and 40.23 million by April 2000, for which it was awarded the Guinness World Record for best-selling video game of all time.
