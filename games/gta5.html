    <h2>History of Grand Theft Auto 5</h2>
    <p>
        Grand Theft Auto V is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North 
        and published by Rockstar Games. It is the seventh main entry in the Grand 
        Theft Auto series, following 2008's Grand Theft Auto IV, and the fifteenth 
        instalment overall. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas, based on 
        Southern California, the single-player story follows three protagonists—retired 
        bank robber Michael De Santa, street gangster Franklin Clinton, and drug dealer 
        and gunrunner Trevor Philips—and their attempts to commit heists while under 
        pressure from a corrupt government agency and powerful criminals. Players freely 
        roam San Andreas's open world countryside and fictional city of Los Santos, based 
        on Los Angeles.
