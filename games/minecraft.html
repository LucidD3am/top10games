    <h2>History of Minecraft</h2>
        <p>
        Minecraft is a sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios and originally released 
        in 2009. The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming
         language. Following several early private testing versions, it was first made 
         public in May 2009 before being fully released in November 2011, with Notch 
         stepping down and Jens "Jeb" Bergensten taking over development. Minecraft has
          become the best-selling video game in history, with over 300 million copies 
          sold and nearly 140 million monthly active players as of 2023. It has been 
          ported to several platforms.

            Minecraft surpassed over a million purchases less than a month after 
            entering its beta phase in early 2011. At the same time, the 
            game had no publisher backing and has never been commercially advertised 
            except through word of mouth, and various unpaid references in popular
             media such as the Penny Arcade webcomic. By April 2011, Persson 
             estimated that Minecraft had made â‚¬23 million (US$33 million) in revenue, 
             with 800,000 sales of the alpha version of the game, and over 1 million 
             sales of the beta version. In November 2011, prior to the game's full 
             release, Minecraft beta surpassed 16 million registered users and 4 
             million purchases. By March 2012, Minecraft had become the 6th 
             best-selling PC game of all time. As of 10 October 2014, the 
             game had sold 17 million copies on PC, becoming the best-selling PC game 
             of all time. On 25 February 2014, the game reached 100 million 
             registered users. By May 2019, 180 million copies had been 
             sold across all platforms, making it the single best-selling video 
             game of all time. The free-to-play Minecraft China version had over 
             300 million players by November 2019. By April 2021, Minecraft
             sold more than 238 million copies worldwide. As of 2023, the game 
             has sold over 300 million copies.

            The Xbox 360 version of Minecraft became profitable within the first 
            day of the game's release in 2012, when the game broke the Xbox Live 
            sales records with 400,000 players online. Within a week of being on 
            the Xbox Live Marketplace, Minecraft sold upwards of a million copies.
            GameSpot announced in December 2012 that Minecraft sold over 4.48 million 
            copies since the game debuted on Xbox Live Arcade in May 2012. In 2012, 
            Minecraft was the most purchased title on Xbox Live Arcade; it was also
            the fourth most played title on Xbox Live based on average unique users 
            per day. As of 4 April 2014, the Xbox 360 version has sold 12 million 
            copies. In addition, Minecraft: Pocket Edition has reached a figure of 
            21 million in sales. The PlayStation 3 Edition sold one million copies 
            in five weeks. The release of the game's PlayStation Vita version boosted
            Minecraft sales by 79%, outselling both PS3 and PS4 debut releases and 
            becoming the largest Minecraft launch on a PlayStation console.
            The PS Vita version sold 100,000 digital copies in Japan within 
            the first two months of release, according to an announcement by 
            SCE Japan Asia. By January 2015, 500,000 digital copies of Minecraft 
            were sold in Japan across all PlayStation platforms, with a surge in 
            primary school children purchasing the PS Vita version. As of 2022, the 
            Vita version has sold over 1.65 million physical copies in Japan, making 
            it the best-selling Vita game in the country. Minecraft helped improve 
            Microsoft's total first-party revenue by $63 million for the 2015 second 
            quarter.
