    <h2>History of Red Dead Redemption 2</h2>
    <p>
        Red Dead Redemption 2 is a 2018 action-adventure game developed and 
        published by Rockstar Games. The game is the third entry in the Red Dead 
        series and a prequel to the 2010 game Red Dead Redemption. The story is set 
        in a fictionalized representation of the United States in 1899 and follows the 
        exploits of Arthur Morgan, an outlaw and member of the Van der Linde gang, who 
        must deal with the decline of the Wild West while attempting to survive against 
        government forces, rival gangs, and other adversaries. The game is presented 
        through first- and third-person perspectives, and the player may freely roam in 
        its interactive open world. Gameplay elements include shootouts, robberies, 
        hunting, horseback riding, interacting with non-player characters, and 
        maintaining the character's honor rating through moral choices and deeds. 
        A bounty system governs the response of law enforcement and bounty hunters to 
        crimes committed by the player.

    <h2>Sales</h2>

        Since the previous installment in the series was among the highest-reviewed and best-selling games of the seventh generation of video game consoles, many analysts believed Red Dead Redemption 2 would be one of the 
        highest-selling games of 2018 and have a great effect on other game sales during the fourth quarter. After the game's announcement in October 2016, analyst Ben Schacter of Macquarie Research estimated it would 
        sell 12 million copies in its first quarter, while analysts at Cowen and Company gave a "conservative" estimate of 15 million sales. In July 2018, industry analyst Mat Piscatella predicted Red Dead Redemption 2 
        would be the best-selling game of 2018, outselling other blockbuster titles such as Battlefield V, Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, and Fallout 76; some industry commentators noted frequent franchises like Assassin's Creed 
        and Call of Duty were launching their 2018 entries—Odyssey and Black Ops 4, respectively—earlier than usual, predicting an avoidance of competition with Red Dead Redemption 2. Shortly before release in October 2018, 
        Schacter estimated the game would sell 15 million copies in its first quarter, though noted investor expectations were at 20 million copies; Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities predicted 25 million. Michael Olson of 
        Piper Jaffray projected revenue between US$400 and US$500 million in the first three days, while Doug Creutz of Cowen Inc. estimated between US$550 and US$600 million.
